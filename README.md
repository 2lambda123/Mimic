Welcome to the ISS Mimic project repository! 

The goal of our project is to create a Raspberry Pi + Arduino system that retrieves actual telemetry from the International Space Station (ISS) and uses that data to rotate components on a 3D printed ISS model in order to make the ISS model match up with the exist configuration of the real ISS in real time. The project also will display the telemetry in an informative manner along with detailed information about the ISS to increase public awareness.

We are a group of dedicated ISS program employees and enthusiasts trying to share our love of the space program through this awesome project.

DISCLAIMER - We are not professional programmers. All the code maintained here was created to work toward our specific goal, and much of it was using languages that none of us had used before. You may find the structure, style, and lack of comments to be completely novice and infuriating. You may scream out in frustration, laugh in disgust, or even weep at the obfuscated nonsense appearing before your eyes. 

That said, feel free to improve upon our caffeine-induced, late-night, insanity-plagued programming madness or even just scrap it all and make something better using our ideas.
