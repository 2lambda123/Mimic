# Welcome to Mini Mimic !!

Hello World!   I am Mini, a 0.5% scale model of the International Space Station (ISS), very nice to meet you!  Though I may be small, I am mighty in my capabilities.  Just like my larger counterpart, I can articulate!  My Solar Array Wings and rotary joints move in sync with the real ISS in space!  This made possible by the power of coding with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, conjunction with NASA public data, bringing me to life and allowing me to mimic the movements of the ISS.  

Despite being half the size of the original Mimic, I am packed with intricate details and features that make me a faithful representation of the ISS.  My compact size makes me more portable, more affordable and fun to build, bring the thrill of space exploration right into your hands.  

As you assemble me, piece by piece, you'll find yourself immersed in the fascinating world of space, and the engineering marvels that make the ISS.  You will learn about 3D printing, get hands-on experience with coding, and gain a deeper understanding of how the ISS works.

So come, embark on this stellar journey with me.  Together, we'll bring you little closer to space!  
Remember, sky is not the limit when you have Mini Mimic in your hands.  I can't wait to come to live by your hands!
