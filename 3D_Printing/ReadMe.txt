Every major component of the ISS will be inside it's own folder (appended with _Final if no more design changes are anticipated).

Every folder should include all the separate STL files required to print every piece of the component.

The folder will also include a STEP file of the CAD used to create the STL in case anyone desires to modify it. Also we'll try to include the Fusion 360 F3D files for easier modification.

The _raw STL file will be the barebones starting point model we extracted from the high fidelity ISS blender model, we take these models and refine them so they can be 3d printed.
